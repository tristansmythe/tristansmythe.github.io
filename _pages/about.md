# About me
I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) at the National Wildlife Research Centre in Ottawa, ON. I'm an analytical chemist. A hiker. A birder. And Canadian [Yonsei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonsei_(Japanese_diaspora)). I'm also a mu-dan (unranked) practitioner of [Kyūdō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyūdō). ![Pusheen the Cat leading a Science Show - Drawn by Kelly Stanford](/images/measpusheenKellyStanford){: .align-right width="300px"}   

## Research Interests
With the ever increasing complexity of chemical mixtures that humans and wildlife are exposed to, modernized and higher throughput methods are necessary to both detect and quantify contaminants in the environment, and to evaluate how these chemicals interact with the body. Environmental monitoring programs are typically limited to known contaminants, but advances in non-targeted analysis (NTA) methods provide the means for more complete measurements of the chemical 'exposome'. However, exposure alone provides an incomplete picture into the fate of these chemicals, as their behaviour in the body may result in the accumulation, detoxification, removal, or even transformation into more toxic forms. My research sits at the interface of analytical chemistry and molecular biology - characterizing chemical mixtures in complex environmental matrices (e.g., bird eggs), and using analytical, biochemical, and computational techniques to probe their interactions with key targets in the body (e.g., proteins).

## Prior experience
I completed my PhD in Chemistry (specialization in Chemical and Environmental Toxicology) at Carleton University under the supervision of Dr. Robert Letcher. My thesis studied the behaviour and toxicokinetics (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) of flame retardants and flame retardant transformation products in Laurentian Great Lakes herring gulls. I have expertise in conducting microsomal depletion assays for the measurement of chemical metabolism _in vitro_, and in generating structure activity relationships (SARs) and modelling small-molecule-protein complexes _in silico_. Prior to starting my PhD in Ottawa, I briefly worked at the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans in Winnipeg where I studied the temporal and geographic distribution of various chemical classes in beluga populations across the Canadian Arctic. 

## Current work
My current research is focused on the development of non-targeted suspect screening methods for the measurement of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in 3 species of birds: european starlings, tree swallows, and American herring gulls.
